# Game-Website
Björil (translation: beartterfly) is our protagonist–a small warrior bear with butterfly eyes and aerodynamics similar to his winged cousins. Thankfully, he still has enough muscle strength to wield the weapons we give him…

As for what he’s doing trying to escape from our ‘dungeons’, the reason he is represented as a soldier is because he fought mental battles and continues to with help from the player. He escaped from a laboratory where he was held captive for experiments, but his time there did not actually provide him with any helpful enhancements (he was born with intelligence and physical capabilities similar to humans). The captive period of his life only gifted him PTSD comparable to that of war veterans, hence his design. Our rooms/levels he needs to exit are just the increasingly more complex parts of his mind that haunt him, but we can ease into explaining to the players why or how they are ‘helping’ him by playing.

Room designs can vary and will represent places he’s seen or reflect headspaces and emotional states he’s in (kind of like the different locations in Omori).

Stats (we can edit these as we see fit for the gameplay itself):
Height: 1m/~3ft
Weight: 0.03g
Age: unknown, his peers have been known to live up to a millenia
Languages: any human language, can communicate with all creatures above land including nonmagical
Family: lost but not extinct, in hiding 
Friends: favorite zookeeper, Hampstead “Hammie” the flying dugong, the player (we can have him turn to talk to the pov even though we will also be playing as him), ??
Likes: berries, talking to butterflies, parks/sitting in trees and people-watching 
Dislikes: drilling noises, bright lights, humans with clothes too clean or neat

Extra tidbits:
Björil was left by his family in a zoo due to fleeing from magical political conflict. They thought he’d be safer with the regular bears from their own enemies, but he was discovered by unethical researchers because of his abnormal face and weight.
Despite his weight, Björil can’t fly. He lacks the ability to jump high enough to catch an updraft, and even if he did he’d be too clumsy to steer himself in directions that keep him in the air.
The game is not played in Björil’s actual universe, levels are just the vast landscapes of his mind. The closest you can get to his world in real time are by unlocking photos of memories from his past. 
Hammie escaped the lab with Björil but parted ways to fight alongside his own in the magical war. He was bought from an aquarium with similar practices to Seaworld… (rip Shamu)
